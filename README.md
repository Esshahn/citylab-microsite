# CityLAB Site

## Update site

This site is deployed by Netlify (Net-liff-eye ). A push to ```master``` will automatically update the site and set live. If you have bigger updates, please create a new branch.

``` bash
# install dependencies
$ npm install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:3000
$ npm run dev

# build for production and launch server
$ npm run build
$ npm start

# generate static project
$ npm run generate
```
