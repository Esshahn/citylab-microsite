# CityLAB Site

## Update site

This site is deployed by Netlify (Net-liff-eye ). A push to ```master``` will automatically update the site and set live. If you have bigger updates, please create a new branch.

## Add events

### Hero images

- Hero images should have a resolution of **1880px x 940px** and are required to create a new event. If you don't have any software to crop your images you can use this [Online Photo Editor](https://www.befunky.com/create/crop-photo/).
- Images are located inside the folder of the website at ```static/images/events/```.
- Please use the following naming convention: ```dirname-hero.jpg```.


``` bash
# install dependencies
$ npm install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:3000
$ npm run dev

# build for production and launch server
$ npm run build
$ npm start

# generate static project
$ npm run generate
```
